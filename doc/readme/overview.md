# üïØÔ∏è Overview

**Markus's Groovy Boomi** brings the following advantages without any disatvantage. The only 'cost' is to get used to it, which normally takes a bit of time, and it requires your personal commitment to want to work with Groovy Script. If you don't like scripting, yet, you may want to give it a try. Maybe you will love scripting afterwards. I recommend [Groovy-Learn](https://groovy-lang.org/learn.html).
