# Getting Started

Before you can start with your first project you have to check the [pre-requisites](<Pre-Requisites 7deb11c4cf894c33b76456ab85cad596.md>).

The second step is then to prepare your local environment, that you will need to develop and test Groovy scripts.

Last but not least, you will create a project per customer to develop scripts in the context of a customer project.
