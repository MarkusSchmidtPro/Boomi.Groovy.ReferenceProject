# Hello World

## The Debug Window

**Debug** the Test! Debugging will alow you to stop on breakpoints or to see variables.

</div>

You have executed the Hello World Test! First thing to look at is the **Debug Window.**

{% hint style="info" %}
Forget about those WARNINGs. You cannot get rid of them. They appear because Groovy v2.4.13 is outdated, from IntelliJ's point of view.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You can see all logs and outputs in the debug window. There is also the **Threads & Variables** Windows that you will use if you work with breakpoints to see your variables and data.

## Breakpoint

Set a breakpoint in your script (left-click on the row-number where you want to stop) and **Debug** the Test again. The execution stops on the calculation line. Watch you variables:

Step over the current line - execute the calculation.

and check your variables
